# Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms, each designed to demonstrate clear functionality with comprehensive logging and detailed explanations. The goal of this collection is to provide an educational resource for understanding the behavior of these algorithms, alongside their trade-offs and use cases.

## Features

- **Detailed Logging**
  Each algorithm includes useful logging to help visualize its behavior during execution. These logs can provide insights into intermediate steps, helping users understand the inner workings of the algorithm.

- **Space and Time Complexity Analysis**
  All implementations are accompanied by comments that break down their time and space complexity. This helps evaluate their performance and suitability for various scenarios.

- **Pros and Cons**
  Each algorithm includes notes on its strengths and weaknesses, offering guidance on when to use it and when alternative approaches might be more appropriate.

- **Use Cases**
  Practical examples and scenarios for applying each algorithm are included to highlight real-world relevance and utility.

## Why This Repository?

This collection serves as a practical resource for:
- **Students** learning the basics of algorithms and data structures.
- **Developers** seeking reference implementations for common algorithms.
- **Engineers** evaluating algorithmic solutions for specific problems.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! ðŸŽ‰ If youâ€™d like to:
- Add new algorithms
- Enhance existing implementations
- Improve the documentation

Feel free to open a **pull request**. Please ensure that new additions follow the same format with logging, complexity analysis, and detailed commentary.
